# Issue labels

* [Mapping_review](https://github.com/GO-ROCHE-COLLAB/Roche_CV_mapping/labels/Mapping_review)
Every RCV term mapping should have a single ticket named 'Review {RCV_NAME} {RVC_ID}' with the label Mapping_review.  
If there are multiple tickets with this name, the label should be removed from one, 
and the two tickets should be linked by referencing one in a comment on the other (just type # and use the autocomplete).
If the additional ticket is simply a duplicate add the duplicate label and close it.  If it requires some other action, 
just leave open but WITHOUT the Mapping_review tag

* [mapping_completed](https://github.com/GO-ROCHE-COLLAB/Roche_CV_mapping/labels/mapping_completed)
This label indicates that we are not longer working on improving this mapping.  It should only be added to closed tickets.

* [duplicate](https://github.com/GO-ROCHE-COLLAB/Roche_CV_mapping/labels/duplicate)
What it says on the tin.  All duplicates should be closed.

* [GO_work_still_needed](https://github.com/GO-ROCHE-COLLAB/Roche_CV_mapping/labels/GO_work_still_needed)
Please don't review yet.

* [Ready_for_review_by_Roche](https://github.com/GO-ROCHE-COLLAB/Roche_CV_mapping/labels/Ready_for_review_by_Roche)
Please review ASAP and close with mapping_completed tag if OK.

* [question](https://github.com/GO-ROCHE-COLLAB/Roche_CV_mapping/labels/question)
What is says on the tin.  Typically a question for Roche that needs answering in order to determine the best key class and pattern to use for auto-mapping.
