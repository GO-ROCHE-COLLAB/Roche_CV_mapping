## Sketch of potential DB schema

### Motivation: 

The tsv based approach, while lightweight, has inevitably ended up re-inventing basic aspects of DBs 
- functionality that would be easier to manage in SQL: uniqueness constraints, foreign keys, results table sorting...
The tsv system is also inevitably denormalised.

## Approach

- See [VFB_owl schema]().  Also - [Dead simple OWL design patterns]().
