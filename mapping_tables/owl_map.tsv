RCV_NAME	RCV_ID	Key Class Name	Key Class ID	Applied pattern	Notes
B cells	RCV_000001	B cell	CL_0000236	has_participant_cell	Internal: Getting some undesirable results because of overly broad axioms on 'B-cell mediated immune response'.  Missing results are becuase we need to include 'regulates some (has_participant some 'B cell') + has_participant some (develops_into some 'B cell'.  Requires 3 queries OR using HermiT.
BDNF pathway	RCV_000002	brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor signaling pathway	GO_0031547	is_a_OR_part_of_OR_regulates	
BMP pathway	RCV_000003	BMP pathway	GO_0030509	is_a_OR_part_of_OR_regulates	Internal: Missing binding, secretion ligand etc.  Need a way to ask for processes with BMP as participant.
DNA binding process	RCV_000005	DNA binding process	GO_0003677	Equivalence	Laura: Looks good?
DNA damage	RCV_000006	DNA damage response, detection of DNA damage	GO_0042769	is_a_OR_part_of	
DNA recombination	RCV_000008	DNA recombination	GO_0006310	Equivalence	Laura: Perhaps this is just very incomplete? There are only 3 manual mappings.  The key class looks justified, but has 51 classes.  If you need a more constrained definition, can you suggest one?
DNA repair	RCV_000009	DNA repair	GO_0006281	is_a_OR_part_of_OR_regulates_OR_capable_of	Laura: The manual map includes the odd regulation term and complex, so I've used a pattern that includes both of these.  But including these results in a much larger list than the manual one.  Should we keep this pattern?
DNA replication negative	RCV_000011	negative regulation of DNA replication	GO_0008156	Equivalence	Laura: Only 1 automated mapping. Not related to manually mapped class! Can you suggest a different definition/key class mapping?
DNA replication	RCV_000010	DNA replication	GO_0006260	is_a_OR_part_of_OR_regulates	
DNA silencing	RCV_000012	gene silencing	GO_0016458	is_a_OR_part_of_OR_regulates

zzinc ion homeostasis	RCV_000359	zinc ion homeostasis	GO_0055069	is_a_OR_part_of	Internal: GO axiomatisation insufficient?

wound healing	RCV_000356	wound healing	GO_0042060	is_a_OR_part_of_OR_regulates	
CTGF	RCV_000004	connective tissue growth factor	PRO?	?	Internal: No axioms on key class.  Look into adding from Pro?
DNA dynamics	RCV_000007	?		?	
G-protein	RCV_000017	?		?	Laura: Having trouble automating this as its meaning seems much more constrained than implied my the name.  Manual mapping is only regulation of GPCR signaling pathway terms whose names explicilty reference  activity GPCR signaling. Is a broad interpretation correct, or should change the name to positive 
GABAergic	RCV_000018	?		?	
GPCR signaling	RCV_000019	G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway	GO_0007186	Equivalence	Manual mapping is only adenylate-cyclase signaling pathway. Should it be renamed, or would a broader mapping be appropriate ?
GTPase activity	RCV_000020	GTPase activity	GO_0003924	is_a_OR_part_of_OR_regulates_OR_capable_of	Manual mapping includes obsolete terms for individual G-protein subunits, automated mapping will pull in whole complex.
MAPK inactivation	RCV_000021	negative regulation of MAP kinase activity	GO_0043407	Equivalence	
MAPK signalling	RCV_000022	MAPK cascade	GO_0000165	is_a_OR_part_of_OR_regulates

RNA interference	RCV_000031	RNA interference	GO_0016246	is_a_OR_part_of	Manual mapping seems to be to antisense RNA terms that are not necessarily connected with RNA interference?
